# React Portfolio

## Deployed Site
https://lpenenburgh.github.io/React-Portfolio/

## Description 
Updated original portfolio site to use React and deployed to Github Pages. Using React, I was able to seperate my components and re-use them on multiple pages without having to repeat code. React Router allows the user to navigate between pages with ease.
